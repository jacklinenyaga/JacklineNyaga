## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Jackline Njoki Nyaga, a passionate educator and researcher with a background in Ecotourism and Hospitality Management, as well as Technical Trainer Education. With experience in teaching, research, and client service, I am dedicated to fostering learning and innovation in diverse fields. Beyond my expertise in tourism and education, I am determined to learn tech, embracing new challenges with curiosity and a growth mindset. My adaptability and commitment to continuous learning make me eager to explore opportunities in the ever-evolving tech landscape.
  - ðŸ”­ I am currently focused on expanding my skills in technology, particularly coding, as I explore new opportunities beyond my background in tourism and education. As a beginner in tech, I am eager to build a strong foundation in programming and digital tools that can complement my expertise in education.
  
  - I am currently exploring coding as a beginner and looking into foundational programming languages such as Python and HTML/CSS. Python interests me because of its versatility in data analysis, automation, and web development, while HTML/CSS will help me enhance my skills in website creation, which aligns with my project of building a website for Jâ€™s restaurant. As I progress, I am also open to learning JavaScript to improve interactivity on web platforms. My goal is to develop practical tech skills that can complement my expertise in education, research, and environmental advocacy.
  
  - With reference to the IYF Computer programming course, I will be learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js (Here is a link to the course outline https://programming-iyf.harak-a.xyz/about)
